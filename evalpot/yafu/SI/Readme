This NN PES has been tested on 64bit Linux platform with intel compiler and
MKL library (Makefile.intel). The user could also use gfortran, blas and
lapack library (Makefile.gnu) if the intel counterparts are not available.

nn.f90 pes.f90 are the source codes for NN PES.
main.f90 provides a sample calling: first call pesinit to initialize the PES,
then call the main evaluation subroutine: NNEvaluate.
In the test directory, the user can simply enter ../test.x in command line
to run the testing program, which would generate the data for plotting the
dissociative path in Fig. 3. The test directory contains all the definition
files needed to use this PES.
